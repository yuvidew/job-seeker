## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/):** React-based framework for building server-rendered applications.
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/):** Typed superset of JavaScript for static type checking.
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/):** Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **[Shadcn UI](https://shadcn.dev/):** UI components library for consistent and accessible design.

### Backend
- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/):** JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
- **[Express.js](https://expressjs.com/):** Web framework for Node.js to create APIs and handle HTTP requests.
- **[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/):** NoSQL database for storing user information and application data.
- **[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/):** Platform used for storing resumes and generating file links.

## Key Features

### User Signup and Authentication
- **Sign-Up Form:** 
  - Users can sign up by providing their basic information, such as name, email, and password.
  - Form validation is implemented using TypeScript to ensure all required fields are correctly filled out.
  - Passwords are securely hashed before being stored in MongoDB.

- **Data Storage:**
  - User information is stored in MongoDB, ensuring scalability and efficient data retrieval.
  - MongoDB collections are designed with Mongoose schemas to enforce data integrity and consistency.

### Resume Upload Functionality
- **Resume Upload Form:**
  - After signing up, users can upload their resumes through an intuitive upload form.
  - The form supports various file types, and validation is enforced to ensure only valid resume formats are uploaded.

- **Firebase Integration:**
  - The uploaded resume is stored in Firebase Storage.
  - Once the upload is successful, Firebase generates a unique download link for the resume, which is then stored in MongoDB alongside the userâ€™s profile.

- **Resume Link Management:**
  - The resume download link can be accessed and shared by the user.
  - Firebase ensures that the uploaded files are securely stored and can be easily retrieved using the unique link.

### Responsive and Accessible UI
- **Shadcn UI Components:**
  - The application uses Shadcn UI components to ensure a consistent and accessible user experience across all devices.
  - Components like buttons, input fields, and forms are styled using Tailwind CSS, providing a modern and responsive design.

- **Tailwind CSS for Custom Styling:**
  - Custom styles are created using Tailwind CSS, allowing for quick adjustments and ensuring the application meets design standards.
  - Responsive breakpoints are utilized to provide a seamless experience across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

### User Profile Management
- **Profile Dashboard:**
  - After signing up, users have access to a dashboard where they can view and manage their profile information.
  - Users can update their personal information and manage their resume uploads.

- **Data Security:**
  - User data is secured through authentication and encrypted storage solutions.
  - Sensitive information such as passwords is hashed, and MongoDB and Firebase are configured with security best practices.

## Implementation Details

### Frontend
- **Next.js** is used for server-side rendering, ensuring that the application is fast and SEO-friendly.
- **TypeScript** adds a layer of type safety, reducing bugs and improving code maintainability.
- **Tailwind CSS** allows for rapid UI development with utility classes, enabling a responsive design that adapts to various screen sizes.
- **Shadcn UI** provides pre-built, accessible components that are customized to match the application's branding.

### Backend
- **Node.js** and **Express.js** handle API requests, user authentication, and interaction with MongoDB.
- **MongoDB** stores user profiles, including their name, email, and the resume link generated by Firebase.
- **Firebase** is used for storing resumes, leveraging its scalable storage solution and providing secure access to the files via generated links.

## Conclusion

This Job-Seeker Web Application leverages modern web technologies to provide a robust, secure, and user-friendly platform for job seekers. By combining Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI for the frontend with Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Firebase for the backend, the application ensures a smooth user experience, efficient data management, and secure storage solutions.
